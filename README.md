   - Collected historical traffic data from sensors, cameras, etc.
   - Explored the dataset for structure, variables, and patterns using statistical and visual analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing data through imputation and removal.
   - Identified and addressed outliers affecting the accuracy of predictions.
   - Converted categorical variables to numerical formats for modeling purposes.
   - Normalized numerical features to ensure consistent scale across variables.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted relevant features such as time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions.
   - Created lag features to capture historical traffic patterns.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized traffic data using charts and graphs to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.
   - Analyzed traffic flow at different times and days to uncover insights.

5. **Conclusion**
   - Summarized key findings and insights from the analysis, providing actionable recommendations for optimizing traffic flow in smart cities.

## Project 2: Stock Price Analysis

### Objective
Analyze and predict stock prices using LSTM.

### Dataset
Stock market data from Kaggle.

### Project Overview
1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted relevant features such as time, day, and relevant economic indicators.
   - Created lag features to capture historical stock price patterns.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized stock information using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand historical trends.
   - Analyzed risk based on previous stock performance.

3. **Stock Price Prediction using LSTM**
   - Utilized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting future stock prices.
   - Implemented a model using the yfinance library for NSE.

4. **Conclusion**
   - Summarized key findings and insights from the analysis, including predictions of future stock prices and identified factors influencing stock performance.

## Project 3: Healthcare Data Analysis for Diabetes Prediction
